Task : player1 and player2 are two instances of class Player. The task is to build a messaging app. When a player receives a message, it replies â€œreceived message + number of message that it has already sent.Step 1:	It is possible to implement this feature by linking two objects. But it will create a recursive cycle where player object will not have individual control.Step 2: 	It is possible to provide individual control for each instance by using thread. P1 send a message to p2 but indirectly. P1 put its message to the postbox of p2. P2 continuously checks is there any message/letter in its postbox. If there is a message, it replies back to the postbox of p1. This way there will be no recursive call cycle.Thus, I have implemented this design for this task. Step 3:	When two objects are in different java process/JVM, then have no shared memory. Thus, socket-based communication method has been implemented for task 7.
